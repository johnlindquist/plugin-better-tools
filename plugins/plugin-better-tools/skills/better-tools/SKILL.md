description: Analyze the local Better Tools corpus of Codex tool calls, identify tool optimization opportunities and blindspots, propose new tools or skills, and suggest focused AGENTS.md/software-engineering improvements based on observed agent behavior.

# Better Tools

Use this skill when the user wants to improve tools over time from observed Codex tool usage, asks for a tool blindspot analysis, wants suggestions for new tools/MCP servers/skills/scripts, or asks how AGENTS.md should change based on recent agent behavior.

## Data Source

The companion `PreToolUse` hook stores a rolling corpus under `$PLUGIN_DATA` when Codex provides it, falling back to:

```text
~/.codex/plugin-data/plugin-better-tools/
```

The raw store is a capped daily JSONL spool under `events/`. Do not load raw JSONL into the conversation by default. Use `better_tools.py` to generate deduped summaries and `indexes/tool-index.json`, which collapse duplicate calls by input hash and normalized command pattern.

## Workflow

1. Run the analyzer from the plugin root:

```bash
python3 "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/better_tools.py" doctor
python3 "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/better_tools.py" index --days 30
python3 "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/better_tools.py" summary --days 30
```

If `$PLUGIN_ROOT` is not available in the current shell, use the installed plugin path or the development checkout:

```bash
python3 /Users/johnlindquist/dev/plugin-better-tools/plugins/plugin-better-tools/scripts/better_tools.py summary --days 30
```

2. Use the report as evidence, not as the final answer. Inspect the current project before making durable recommendations:

```bash
pwd
ls
find .. -maxdepth 2 -name AGENTS.md -o -name package.json -o -name pyproject.toml -o -name Cargo.toml
```

3. If the user asks for researched tool recommendations, browse current official docs or primary sources for the candidate tools before recommending them.

4. Classify each recommendation:

- `AGENTS.md`: a concise instruction that would have improved observed agent behavior.
- `script`: a repo-local command that compresses a repeated shell workflow.
- `skill`: an agent workflow for recurring judgment-heavy work.
- `MCP/tool`: a capability gap where structured APIs would beat shell scraping or ad hoc browser work.
- `defer`: a weak signal that needs more logged events.

5. Guide the user through one improvement at a time. For each proposal, include:

- observed evidence from the corpus
- why the current tool behavior is wasteful or risky
- the smallest better tool or instruction
- the exact file(s) to change
- a falsifiable verification command or runtime proof

## Output Shape

Prefer this structure:

```markdown
## Observed Pattern
<short evidence summary>

## Highest-Leverage Improvement
<one change, not a grab bag>

## Blindspots
<missing tools or verification paths inferred from project type and logs>

## AGENTS.md Suggestions
<patch-ready bullets, or say none>

## Next Verification
<command or runtime proof>
```

Do not dump raw tool arguments unless the user asks. The hook redacts common secret-like keys, but tool arguments may still include sensitive project details.
